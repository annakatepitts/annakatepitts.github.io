        <div id= "text"> <p> Ethically grown coffee is one of the most ignored issues. Most coffee is grown without fair wages and falls under the category of human trafficking. However, it is astronomically expensive to grow coffee ethically. </p>
            <p>It is important to educate oneself about how coffee is grown and by whom. In order to do this, consult labels, preferably those marked "Fair Trade Certified." This means that the coffee is more ethical and fairly traded than others. Check out this  <a href= http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/a-guide-buying-ethical-coffee-180956743/?no-ist> article</a> by the Smithsonian to learn what it means to buy coffee ethically. </p>
            <p> As the temperature gets colder, the consumption of coffee becomes even more popular. This season, support those farmers who do. Here are some links to some good sources for this kind of coffee.
